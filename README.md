# Comment-Toxicity-Project

Created a comment-toxicity Deep Learning model using the dataset from the Kaggle Toxic Comment Classification Challenge. The model uses Tensorflow, Keras, Pandas, Numpy and classic NLP to predict how much toxic, obscene, threatful, insulting the comment is. The model has a 75% precision rate and the code is linked with Gradio App, with the url being active for 72 hours. The model utilises 70% of the dataset for training, another 20% for validating and 10% for testing. Used matplotlib to plot the results of the predictions and its outliers.
